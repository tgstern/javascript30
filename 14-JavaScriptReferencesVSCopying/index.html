            // You might think we can just do something like this:

            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

            // one way
            const team2 = players.slice();

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in
            const team3 = [].concat(players);

            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

            // and think we make a copy:

            // how do we take a copy instead?
            const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

            // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
            const cap3 = { ...person };

            // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
